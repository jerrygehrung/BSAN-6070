# Exploratory Data Analysis – India Pollution Data

## Introduction

> Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics such as mean, standard deviation, and count, so on, often with visual methods. It’s where the researcher takes a bird’s eye view of the data and tries to make some sense of it. It’s often the first step in data analysis, implemented before any formal statistical techniques are applied.
